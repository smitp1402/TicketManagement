# brief 
OLAP query -> admin panel->tab2-> get total ravenue by category (ticket sold for event under particular category)
Subquery->admin panel ->tab 2 -> to get differnt category in filter 
Aggregate query ->user panel -> tab 2 -> display booked event by particular user who logged in 
membership query ->user panel-> tab 2-> click on upcoming event  in 10 days 
set operation ->user panel ->UserEventInfo -> give both filter result by category and by date using set operation 




#IN detail 
Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the functionalities you're building, structured for easy understanding by a second person:

---

### **Admin Panel (Tab 2): Total Revenue by Category**
- **OLAP Query:**
  - Used to calculate the total revenue generated by tickets sold for events grouped by their respective categories.
  - This query aggregates data to provide a clear summary of how much revenue each category has generated.
  - **Purpose:** Gives administrators insights into the performance of event categories in terms of revenue.

- **Implementation:** 
  - The UI in Tab 2 will display a list of categories with their respective total revenues calculated from ticket sales.
  - **Why OLAP?** Because it focuses on summarizing and aggregating data for reporting and analysis.

---

### **Admin Panel (Tab 2): Filtering Categories**
- **Subquery:**
  - Used to fetch distinct categories dynamically for the category filter in the admin panel.
  - The subquery ensures only categories associated with events (and tickets sold) are fetched. It avoids displaying irrelevant or unused categories.
  - **Purpose:** Allows admins to filter revenue data by specific categories.

- **Implementation:**
  - Dropdown in Tab 2 uses the results of the subquery to populate category options for filtering.
  - This ensures a dynamic and context-relevant filter mechanism.

---

### **User Panel (Tab 2): Display Booked Events**
- **Aggregate Query:**
  - Used to fetch a list of events booked by the user who is currently logged in.
  - The query retrieves event details such as names, dates, and booking information using an aggregate function to summarize the user's booking activity.
  - **Purpose:** Provides users with a personalized view of their booked events.

- **Implementation:**
  - Tab 2 in the user panel will display these details, helping users track their bookings.

---

### **User Panel (Tab 2): Upcoming Events**
- **Membership Query:**
  - Used to filter events occurring within the next 10 days from today.
  - This query checks if events fall within the specified date range (membership condition in a set of dates).
  - **Purpose:** Highlights upcoming events that are relevant to the user.

- **Implementation:**
  - When the user clicks on the "Upcoming Events" section in Tab 2, the panel displays events happening soon.

---

### **User Panel (UserEventInfo): Combined Filters**
- **Set Operations:**
  - This functionality applies both category and date filters and combines the results using set operations (e.g., union, intersection).
  - **Union:** Combines results from both filters, showing events matching either filter.
  - **Intersection:** Displays events matching both filters simultaneously.
  - **Purpose:** Provides advanced filtering, enabling users to narrow down events based on their preferences.

- **Implementation:**
  - User applies category and date filters in the `UserEventInfo` section, and the system processes both using set operations to return the final result.
  - **Example:** If a user selects a category *Music* and a date range (next 10 days), the system combines these criteria to show relevant events.

---

### **Summary:**
Each query type serves a distinct purpose:
1. **OLAP Query (Admin Panel - Tab 2):** Revenue analysis by category.
2. **Subquery (Admin Panel - Tab 2):** Dynamic filtering by category.
3. **Aggregate Query (User Panel - Tab 2):** User-specific event bookings.
4. **Membership Query (User Panel - Tab 2):** Upcoming events in the next 10 days.
5. **Set Operations (UserEventInfo):** Advanced filtering by combining category and date results.

These queries ensure that both the admin and user panels deliver tailored insights and functionality efficiently.
